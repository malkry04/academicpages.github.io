- These two news pieces discuss romantic relationships formed over telegraph and telephone lines. However, while the first news piece notes a bit of controversy about the mingling of personal affairs with public business at telegraph offices--the second text details the "telephone romance" that led to an engagement and an upcoming wedding. What could be gained when looking at both news pieces is that both illustrate the telegraph and telephone as tools not only for business and communication but also as new mediums for personal connections and romantic relationships in their early days.
